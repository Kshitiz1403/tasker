# Tasker Profiles & Tasks

A repository to store and manage my Tasker profiles and tasks for Android automation.

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Tasker profiles and tasks that I use to automate various aspects of my Android device. Tasker is a powerful automation app for Android that allows users to create custom profiles and tasks to automate their device.

3. Import the profiles and tasks on another device by copying the files to the Tasker directory
